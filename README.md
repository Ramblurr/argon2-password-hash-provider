# Keycloak Argon2

This is a password hash provider for Keycloak 20+ to support Argon2, Argon2i, and Argon2id hashes.

This is a fork of [dreezey/argon2-password-hash-provider](https://github.com/dreezey/argon2-password-hash-provider) updated to work with mainline Keycloak.

The [original README is here](README.original.md).

MangaDex has no long-term plan to support this fork; rather it's mainly a migration helper for a small subset of users in our systems using those systems.

However PRs etc are still welcome.
